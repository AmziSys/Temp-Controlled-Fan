# Temp-Controlled-Fan

------------------------- Temperature Controlled Fan using Arduino Uno -----------------------

* Intro:
The idea is to monitor the temperature and control a Fan speed based on the measured temperature using Arduino Uno. In case the temperature exceeds a certain limit, a buzzer will make an audio signal (beep)

* Design
  The design contains:
    - Arduino Uno R3
    - Potentiometer (10K)
    - Temperature Sensor (LM35)
    - LCD (LM016L)
    - Fan
    - Buzzer
    - Transistor, diode, and a couple of resistors
    - 
* Firmware:
  The code was developed in the Arduino IDE environment 

The design was made in Proteus
